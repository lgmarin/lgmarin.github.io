Welcome to another developer blog! 

Here I will post some tutorials and things that I find interesting and that I’m learning, to be a place for me and for anyone else that passes by to gather some information and remember how to solve some problems in this crazy field.

I will also use this blog to show some of the things that I’m currently working on. By the way, you should check my [Projects][projects] page, where I will list my main projects that I’m working on. Also, feel free to take a look at my [Github][ghub] Profile and check my projects!
