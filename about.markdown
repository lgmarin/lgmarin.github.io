# About Me

Hi! My name is Luiz Marin and I'm an Engineer from Brazil that always loved to code! I've been fooling around with Linux Distros and Programming Languages since I was 15 years old.

I have experience with Python, MySQL, Flask and Docker for Web Development. Right now I'm learning more about C# and .NET.

# Why this Blog?

Well, I love to learn new stuff, and I think this blog could help to document all the new stuff that I find. Also, some friends of mine are currently learning to code, and I'm more than pleased to help them initiate in this amazing endeavour, but I always find that some tutorials are too long or not direct to the point, and of course, I often need to remember some things some time :). So, I expect that this blog will be an awesome reference guide for us and for everyone that passes by.
