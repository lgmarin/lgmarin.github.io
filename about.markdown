# About Me

Hi! My name is Luiz Marin and I'm an Engineer from Brazil that always loved to code! I've been fooling around with Linux Distros and Programming Languages since I was 15 years old. 
I've been doing some projects with Python and C#, and some IoT stuff with ESP32 and Arduino for some time.

# Why to Blog?

Well, I love to learn new stuff, and I think this blog could help to document all the new stuff that I find. Also, some friends of mine are currently learning to code, and I'm more than pleased to help them initiate in this amazing endeavour, but I always find that some tutorials are too long or not direct to the point, and of course, I often need to remember some things some time :). So, I expect that this blog will be an awesome reference guide for us and for everyone that passes by.
